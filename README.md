### Hi there 👋
## I'm Arezoo

I started working with my computer and probing into programming with a dial-up internet connection:). Having learned computer, I noticed I was passionate about coding, which takes me away from the routine life. It’s been always challenging for me to deal with a system with millions of users. Consequently, I adore coding. I dived in the world of programming with Java. Apart from that, I started mastering Microservices Design patterns. Moreover, I’ve been learning as well as working in the programming since 2015.

🌱 My main goals for this year are:

😻 Deepening my knowledge of Java

👩‍💻 Developing my own personal website

👩‍🏫 Learning more about Linux

🗣️ Learning a new language

🎥 Seeing more videos and series

🏃‍♀️Run morrre
